## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to pay attention on how the website was designed. First, I destructured the website by breaking into HTML elements, then I looked at what elements have the same characteristics. For example: the whole page has the same font, so I applied it to the whole page * (all types of elements in an HTML page).

```css
* {
    font-family: "Red Hat Display", serif;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

- Button Animation
